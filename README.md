# The A List by the A Team - Rayan, Tawfiq, Suha & Matt
Our link : https://facn4.github.io/ToDo_theAteam/skeleton/index.html

## Section 1. Why?
This web app is a basic To-Do list app. It allows a user to add to-dos, delete them and mark them as complete.

This project gave us experience of working with test-driven development (TDD), DOM manipulation and an opportunity to practice our HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

Section 2. What?
The website contains:
* A header with the brand name
* An input box for to-dos and a submit button
* A list of each to-do item along with a button to delete to-dos and mark them as complete.

## Section 3. How?

## Reference - User Stories
We met the following user stories with our website:

- [ ] Users can enter tasks into a web page so that they don't forget them<br>
- [ ] Users can view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day<br>
- [ ] Tasks can be marked as complete so that the user can focus on the tasks I have left<br>
- [ ] To-dos are large enough so that the user doesn't hit the wrong one with their thumb<br>

### Potential stretch goals
We also aimed to the meet the following stretch goals:

- [ ] Users can edit their to-dos so that they can amend them if the task changes <br>
- [ ] Users can click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier to check to-dos off <br>
- [ ] Users receive a visual indication of which to-do they are about to interact with so that it's clear what they're editing
